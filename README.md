# 🎬 Sprint 3 - JavaScript II: Unit Testing

This repository contains the completed exercises for **Sprint 3** of the IT Academy Frontend course, focused on **JavaScript II** and **unit testing**.

## 📝 Project Overview

The objective of this sprint is to implement logic-only JavaScript functions that work with a dataset of movies. The goal is to pass a series of unit tests provided in the `tests/films.spec.js` file.

Unlike previous sprints, this project does **not render anything to the screen**. Instead, development is driven by tests.

## 🚀 Main Goals

- Use array methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()` and `.sort()`
- Develop clean and testable JavaScript functions
- Pass all the unit tests in the provided test suite
- Understand how to work with a data set of movies
- Learn the fundamentals of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

## 🧪 Running the Tests

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. Then:

```
npm install
npm run test:watch
```
his will generate a file called `test-results.html` which shows the test results.
You can open it with Live Server in VS Code to view your progress in real time.
